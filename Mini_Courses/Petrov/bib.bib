In particular we construct the representation of U(ℊℓ(N)) in terms of first-order differential operators in Givental variables. The construction of this representation turns out to be closely connected with the integral representation based on the factorized Gauss decomposition. We also reveal the recursive structure of the Givental representation and provide the connection with the Baxter Q-operator formalism. Finally the generalization of the integral representation to the infinite and periodic quantum Toda wave functions is discussed.}},

	abstract = {In this paper, we construct graded tensor product characters in terms of generalized difference Macdonald raising operators which form a representation of the quantum Q-system. Characters for the graded tensor product of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules were expressed as the constant term of a non-commutative generating function. This function is written in terms of the generators of a quantum cluster algebra, subject to recursion relations known as the quantum Q-system. The latter form a discrete non-commutative integrable system, with a set of commuting conserved quantities. In type A such conserved quantities can be treated as analogues of the Casimir elements of $U_q({\mathfrak sl}_{r+1})$. We show that the graded tensor product character is the analogue of a class I Whittaker function (to which it reduces in the Demazure case), and that the difference equations which follow from the action of the conserved quantities on characters generalize the difference quantum Toda equations of Etingof. Finally, we construct the graded characters as solutions of these equations, by introducing a representation of the quantum Q-system via difference operators which generalize the Macdonald raising difference operators of Kirillov-Noumi in the dual Whittaker limit.},

	is given by C_n, the n-th Catalan number. This is also the dimension
	of the space SH_n of super-covariant polynomials, that is defined
	as the orthogonal complement of J_n with respect to a given scalar
	product. We construct a basis for R_n whose elements are naturally
	indexed by Dyck paths. This allows us to understand the Hilbert series
	of SH_n in terms of number of Dyck paths with a given number of factors.},

	Stanley and Yan in 2007. We consider random matchings of large size
	and study the maximal crossing and the maximal nesting. It is known
	that the marginal distribution of each of them converges to the GOE
	Tracy-Widom distribution. We show that the maximal crossing and the
	maximal nesting becomes independent asymptotically, and eval- uate
	the joint distribution for the Poissonized random matchings explic-
	itly to the first correction term. This leads to an evaluation of
	the asymptotic of the covariance. Furthermore, we compute the explicit
	second correction term of the distributions function of two ob jects:
	(a) the length of the longest increasing subsequence of Poissonized
	random permutation and (b) the maximal crossing, and hence also the
	maximal nesting, of Poissonized random matching.},

	partially ordered set (poset) encodes essential enumerative and structural
	properties of the poset. Motivated by the algebras generated by the
	down and up operators on posets, we introduce here a family of infinite-dimensional
	associative algebras called down-up algebras. We show that down-up
	algebras exhibit many of the important features of the universal
	enveloping algebra $U(\fsl)$ of the Lie algebra $\fsl$ including
	a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type basis and a well-behaved representation
	theory. We investigate the structure and representations of down-up
	algebras and focus especially on Verma modules, highest weight representations,
	and category $\mathcal O$ modules for them. We calculate the exact
	expressions for all the weights, since that information has proven
	to be particularly useful in determining structural results about
	posets.},

	of the effectiveness of the parsimony method in studying genome rearrangement,
	and leads to a surprising result about the random transposition walk
	on the group of permutations on $n$ elements. Consider this walk
	in continuous time starting at the identity and let $D_t$ be the
	minimum number of transpositions needed to go back to the identity
	from the location at time $t$. $D_t$ undergoes a phase transition:
	the distance $D_{cn/2} \sim u(c)n$, where $u$ is an explicit function
	satisfying $u(c)=c/2$ for $c \le 1$ and $u(c)1$. In other words,
	the distance to the identity is roughly linear during the subcritical
	phase, and after critical time $n/2$ it becomes sublinear. In addition,
	we describe the fluctuations of $D_{cn/2}$ about its mean in each
	of the threeregimes (subcritical, critical and supercritical). The
	techniques used involve viewing the cycles in the random permutation
	as a coagulation-fragmentation process and relating the behavior

	in Part II (A. Borodin, math.RT/9804087) in connection with the problem
	of harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group. The main result
	of the present paper is a determinantal formula for the correlation
	functions. The formula involves a kernel called the matrix Whittaker
	kernel. Each of its two diagonal blocks governs the projection of
	the process on one of the two half-lines; the corresponding kernel
	on the half-line was studied in Part III (A. Borodin and G. Olshanski,
	math/RT/9804088). While the diagonal blocks of the matrix Whitaker
	kernel are symmetric, the whole kernel turns out to be $J$-symmetric,
	i.e., symmetric with respect to a natural indefinite inner product.
	We also discuss a rather surprising connection of our processes with

	abstract = {We consider the asymptotics of the Plancherel measures on partitions
	of $n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. We prove that the local structure
	of a Plancherel typical partition (which we identify with a Young
	diagram) in the middle of the limit shape converges to a determinantal
	point process with the discrete sine kernel. On the edges of the
	limit shape, we prove that the joint distribution of suitably scaled
	1st, 2nd, and so on rows of a Plancherel typical diagram converges
	to the corresponding distribution for eigenvalues of random Hermitian
	matrices (given by the Airy kernel). This proves a conjecture due
	to Baik, Deift, and Johansson by methods different from the Riemann-Hilbert
	techniques used in their original papers math.CO/9810105 and math.CO/9901118
	and from the combinatorial approach proposed by Okounkov in math.CO/9903176.
	Our approach is based on an exact determinantal formula for the correlation
	functions of the poissonized Plancherel measures involving a new
	kernel on the 1-dimensional lattice. This kernel is expressed in
	terms of Bessel functions and we obtain it as a degeneration of the
	hypergeometric kernel from the paper math.RT/9904010 by Borodin and
	Olshanski. Our asymptotic analysis relies on the classical asymptotic
	formulas for the Bessel functions and depoissonization techniques.},

	of harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group. This problem
	leads to a family {P_z} of probability measures, the z-measures,
	which depend on the complex parameter z. The z-measures live on the
	Thoma simplex, an infinite-dimensional compact space which is a kind
	of dual object to the infinite symmetric group. The aim of the paper
	is to introduce stochastic dynamics related to the z-measures. Namely,
	we construct a family of diffusion processes in the Toma simplex
	indexed by the same parameter z. Our diffusions are obtained from
	certain Markov chains on partitions of natural numbers n in a scaling
	limit as n goes to infinity. These Markov chains arise in a natural
	way, due to the approximation of the infinite symmetric group by
	the increasing chain of the finite symmetric groups. Each z-measure
	P_z serves as a unique invariant distribution for the corresponding
	diffusion process, and the process is ergodic with respect to P_z.
	Moreover, P_z is a symmetrizing measure, so that the process is reversible.
	We describe the spectrum of its generator and compute the associated
	(pre)Dirichlet form.},

@article{Borodin2005a,
	abstract = {The infinite-dimensional unitary group U(infinity) is the inductive
	limit of growing compact unitary groups U(N). In this paper we solve
	a problem of harmonic analysis on U(infinity) stated in the previous
	paper math/0109193. The problem consists in computing spectral decomposition
	for a remarkable 4-parameter family of characters of U(infinity).
	These characters generate representations which should be viewed
	as analogs of nonexisting regular representation of U(infinity).
	The spectral decomposition of a character of U(infinity) is described
	by the spectral measure which lives on an infinite-dimensional space
	Omega of indecomposable characters. The key idea which allows us
	to solve the problem is to embed Omega into the space of point configurations
	on the real line without 2 points. This turns the spectral measure
	into a stochastic point process on the real line. The main result
	of the paper is a complete description of the processes corresponding
	to our concrete family of characters. We prove that each of the processes
	is a determinantal point process. That is, its correlation functions
	have determinantal form with a certain kernel. Our kernels have a
	special `integrable' form and are expressed through the Gauss hypergeometric
	function. In simpler situations of harmonic analysis on infinite
	symmetric group and harmonic analysis of unitarily invariant measures

@article{Borodin2000a,
	abstract = {We study a 3-parametric family of stochastic point processes on the
	one-dimensional lattice originated from a remarkable family of representations
	of the infinite symmetric group. We prove that the correlation functions
	of the processes are given by determinantal formulas with a certain
	kernel. The kernel can be expressed through the Gauss hypergeometric
	function; we call it the hypergeometric kernel. In a scaling limit
	our processes approximate the processes describing the decomposition
	of representations mentioned above into irreducibles. As we showed
	before, see math.RT/9810015, the correlation functions of these limit
	processes also have determinantal form with so-called Whittaker kernel.
	We show that the scaling limit of the hypergeometric kernel is the
	Whittaker kernel. The integral operator corresponding to the Whittaker
	kernel is an integrable operator as defined by Its, Izergin, Korepin,
	and Slavnov. We argue that the hypergeometric kernel can be considered
	as a kernel defining a `discrete integrable operator'. We also show
	that the hypergeometric kernel degenerates for certain values of
	parameters to the Christoffel-Darboux kernel for Meixner orthogonal
	polynomials. This fact is parallel to the degeneration of the Whittaker
	kernel to the Christoffel-Darboux kernel for Laguerre polynomials.},

@article{Erdos2010,
	abstract = {We study the universality of spectral statistics of large random matrices.
	We consider $N\times N$ symmetric, hermitian or quaternion self-dual
	random matrices with independent, identically distributed entries
	(Wigner matrices) where the probability distribution for each matrix
	element is given by a measure $\nu$ with a subexponential decay.
	Our main result is that the correlation functions of the local eigenvalue
	statistics in the bulk of the spectrum coincide with those of the
	Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
	(GUE) and the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE), respectively, in
	the limit $N\to \infty$. Our approach is based on the study of the
	Dyson Brownian motion via a related new dynamics, the local relaxation
	flow. As a main input, we establish that the density of eigenvalues
	converges to the Wigner semicircle law and this holds even down to
	the smallest possible scale, and, moreover, we show that eigenvectors
	are fully delocalized. These results hold even without the condition
	that the matrix elements are identically distributed, only independence
	is used. In fact, we give strong estimates on the matrix elements
	of the Green function as well that imply that the local statistics
	of any two ensembles in the bulk are identical if the first four
	moments of the matrix elements match. Universality at the spectral
	edges requires matching only two moments. We also prove a Wegner
	type estimate and that the eigenvalues repel each other on arbitrarily
	small scales.},

	algebra of the Lie algebra of difference operators acting on the
	space of Laurent polynomials in one variable. Fundamental representations
	of $\mathcal E$ are labeled by a continuous parameter $u\in {\mathbb

	familiar from the representation theory of $\mathfrak{gl}_\infty$:
	vector representations, Fock modules, semi-infinite constructions
	of modules. Using tensor products of vector representations, we construct
	surjective homomorphisms from $\mathcal E$ to spherical double affine
	Hecke algebras $S\ddot H_N$ for all $N$. A key step in this construction
	is an identification of a natural bases of the tensor products of
	vector representations with Macdonald polynomials. We also show that
	one of the Fock representations is isomorphic to the module constructed
	earlier by means of the $K$-theory of Hilbert schemes.},

	work is the number of mathematical terms which bear his name. One
	of these is the Selberg integral, an n-dimensional generalization
	of the Euler beta integral. We trace its sudden rise to prominence,
	initiated by a question to Selberg from Enrico Bombieri, more than
	thirty years after publication. In quick succession the Selberg integral
	was used to prove an outstanding conjecture in random matrix theory,
	and cases of the Macdonald conjectures. It further initiated the
	study of q-analogues, which in turn enriched the Macdonald conjectures.
	We review these developments and proceed to exhibit the sustained
	prominence of the Selberg integral, evidenced by its central role
	in random matrix theory, Calogero-Sutherland quantum many body systems,
	Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, and multivariable orthogonal polynomial

	abstract = {A new class of random composition structures (the ordered analog of
	Kingman's partition structures) is defined by a regenerative description
	of component sizes. Each regenerative composition structure is represented
	by a process of random sampling of points from an exponential distribution
	on the positive halfline, and separating the points into clusters
	by an independent regenerative random set. Examples are composition
	structures derived from residual allocation models, including one
	associated with the Ewens sampling formula, and composition structures
	derived from the zero set of a Brownian motion or Bessel process.
	We provide characterisation results and formulas relating the distribution
	of the regenerative composition to the L{\'e}vy parameters of a subordinator
	whose range is the corresponding regenerative set. In particular,
	the only reversible regenerative composition structures are those
	associated with the interval partition of $[0,1]$ generated by excursions
	of a standard Bessel bridge of dimension $2 - 2 \alpha$ for some
	$\alpha \in [0,1]$.},

	abstract = {. In this paper we give a survey of some recent results for random
	walk in random scenery (RWRS). On $\mathbb {Z}^d$, $d\geq 1$, we
	are given a random walk with i.i.d. increments and a random scenery
	with i.i.d. components. The walk and the scenery are assumed to be
	independent. RWRS is the random process where time is indexed by
	$\mathbb {Z}$, and at each unit of time both the step taken by the
	walk and the scenery value at the site that is visited are registered.
	We collect various results that classify the ergodic behavior of
	RWRS in terms of the characteristics of the underlying random walk
	(and discuss extensions to stationary walk increments and stationary
	scenery components as well). We describe a number of results for
	scenery reconstruction and close by listing some open questions.},

@article{Katori2010,
	abstract = {A noncolliding diffusion process is a conditional process of $N$ independent
	one-dimensional diffusion processes such that the particles never
	collide with each other. This process realizes an interacting particle
	system with long-ranged strong repulsive forces acting between any
	pair of particles. When the individual diffusion process is a one-dimensional
	Brownian motion, the noncolliding process is equivalent in distribution
	with the eigenvalue process of an $N \times N$ Hermitian-matrix-valued
	process, which we call Dyson's model. For any deterministic initial
	configuration of $N$ particles, distribution of particle positions
	of the noncolliding Brownian motion on the real line at any fixed
	time $t >0$ is a determinantal point process. We can prove that the
	process is determinantal in the sense that the multi-time correlation
	function for any chosen series of times, which determines joint distributions
	at these times, is also represented by a determinant. We study the
	asymptotic behavior of the system, when the number of Brownian motions
	$N$ in the system tends to infinity. This problem is concerned with
	the random matrix theory on the asymptotics of eigenvalue distributions,
	when the matrix size becomes infinity. In the present paper, we introduce
	a variety of noncolliding diffusion processes by generalizing the
	noncolliding Brownian motion, some of which are temporally inhomogeneous.
	We report the results of our research project to construct and study
	finite and infinite particle systems with long-ranged strong interactions
	realized by noncolliding processes.},

	formula for Jack symmetric polynomials $P_\mu(x;a)$ with a parameter

	$\dim_a$ in the same way as for the Young lattice or Pascal triangle.
	New proofs are given for two known results. The first is the $a$-hook
	formula for $\dim_a$, first found by R.Stanley. Secondly, we prove
	(for all complex $u$ and $v$) a generalization of the identity $\sum\nu(c(b)+u)(c(b)+v)\dim\nu/\dim\mu=(n+1)(n+uv)$,
	where $\nu$ runs over immediate successors of a Young diagram $\mu$
	with $n$ boxes. Here $c(b)$ is the content of a new box $b$. The
	identity is known to imply the existence of an interesting family
	of positive definite central functions on the infinite symmetric
	group. The approach is based on the interpretation of a Young diagram
	as a pair of interlacing sequences, so that analytic techniques may
	be used to solve combinatorial problems. We show that when dealing

@article{Kerov2004,
	abstract = {Let S be the group of finite permutations of the naturals 1,2,...
	The subject of the paper is harmonic analysis for the Gelfand pair
	(G,K), where G stands for the product of two copies of S while K
	is the diagonal subgroup in G. The spherical dual to (G,K) (that
	is, the set of irreducible spherical unitary representations) is
	an infinite-dimensional space. For such Gelfand pairs, the conventional
	scheme of harmonic analysis is not applicable and it has to be suitably
	modified. We construct a compactification of S called the space of
	virtual permutations. It is no longer a group but it is still a G-space.
	On this space, there exists a unique G-invariant probability measure
	which should be viewed as a true substitute of Haar measure. More
	generally, we define a 1-parameter family of probability measures
	on virtual permutations, which are quasi-invariant under the action
	of G. Using these measures we construct a family {T_z} of unitary
	representations of G depending on a complex parameter z. We prove
	that any T_z admits a unique decomposition into a multiplicity free
	integral of irreducible spherical representations of (G,K). Moreover,
	the spectral types of different representations (which are defined
	by measures on the spherical dual) are pairwise disjoint. Our main
	result concerns the case of integral values of parameter z: then
	we obtain an explicit decomposition of T_z into irreducibles. The
	case of nonintegral z is quite different. It was studied by Borodin
	and Olshanski, see e.g. the survey math.RT/0311369.},

@article{Knuth1992,
	abstract = {The author advocates two specific mathematical notations from his
	popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete Mathematics". The first
	of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for
	the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and
	0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic
	functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second
	notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients.
	Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses
	and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should
	be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling
	numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n
	subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first
	suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that
	Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and
	that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those
	satisfied by binomial coefficients.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study properties of the heat semigroup of configuration
	space analysis. Using a natural ``Riemannian-like'' structure of
	the configuration space $\Gamma_X$ over a complete, connected, oriented,
	and stochastically complete Riemannian manifold $X$ of infinite volume,
	the heat semigroup $(e^{-tH^\Gamma})_{t\in\R_+}$ was introduced and
	studied in [{\it J. Func. Anal.} {\bf 154} (1998), 444--500]. Here,
	$H^\Gamma$ is the Dirichlet operator of the Dirichlet form ${\cal
	E}^\Gamma$ over the space $L^2(\Gamma_X,\pi_m)$, where $\pi_m$ is
	the Poisson measure on $\Gamma_X$ with intensity $m$--the volume
	measure on $X$. We construct a metric space $\Gamma_\infty$ that
	is continuously embedded into $\Gamma_X$. Under some conditions on
	the manifold $X$ and we prove that $\Gamma_\infty$ is a set of full
	$\pi_m$ measure. The central results of the paper are two types of
	Feller properties for the heat semigroup. Next, we give a direct
	construction of the independent infinite particle process on the
	manifold $X$, which is a realization of the Brownian motion on the
	configuration space. The main point here is that we prove that this
	process can start in every $\gamma\in\Gamma_\infty$, will never leave
	$\Gamma_\infty$, and has continuous sample path in $\Gamma_\infty$,
	provided $\operatorname{dim}X\ge2$. In this case, we also prove that
	this process is a strong Markov process whose transition probabilities
	are given by the $\P_{t,\gamma}(\cdot)$ above. Furthermore, we discuss
	the necessary changes to be done for constructing the process in
	the case $\operatorname{dim}X=1$. Finally, as an easy consequence
	we get a ``path-wise'' construction of the independent particle process
	on $\Gamma_\infty$ from the underlying Brownian motion.},

@article{Olshanski2009,
	abstract = {We construct a family of Markov processes with continuous sample trajectories
	on an infinite-dimensional space, the Thoma simplex. The family depends
	on three continuous parameters, one of which, the Jack parameter,
	is similar to the beta parameter in random matrix theory. The processes
	arise in a scaling limit transition from certain finite Markov chains,
	the so called up-down chains on the Young graph with the Jack edge
	multiplicities. Each of the limit Markov processes is ergodic and
	its stationary distribution is a symmetrizing measure. The infinitesimal
	generators of the processes are explicitly computed; viewed as selfadjoint
	operators in the L^2 spaces over the symmetrizing measures, the generators
	have purely discrete spectrum which is explicitly described. For
	the special value 1 of the Jack parameter, the limit Markov processes
	coincide with those of the recent work by Borodin and the author
	(Prob. Theory Rel. Fields 144 (2009), 281--318; arXiv:0810.3751).
	In the limit as the Jack parameter goes to 0, our family of processes
	degenerates to the one-parameter family of diffusions on the Kingman
	simplex studied long ago by Ethier and Kurtz in connection with some
	models of population genetics. The techniques of the paper are essentially
	algebraic. The main computations are performed in the algebra of
	shifted symmetric functions with the Jack parameter and rely on the
	concept of anisotropic Young diagrams due to Kerov.},

	where A and B are certain functions on the one-dimensional lattice
	expressed through Euler's Gamma function. The Gamma kernel depends
	on two continuous parameters; its principal minors serve as the correlation
	functions of a determinantal probability measure P defined on the
	space of infinite point configurations on the lattice. As was shown
	earlier (Borodin and Olshanski, Advances in Math. 194 (2005), 141-202;
	arXiv:math-ph/0305043), P describes the asymptotics of certain ensembles
	of random partitions in a limit regime. Theorem: The determinantal
	measure P is quasi-invariant with respect to finitary permutations
	of the nodes of the lattice. This result is motivated by an application

@article{Olshanski2003,
	abstract = {The goal of harmonic analysis on a (noncommutative) group is to decompose
	the most `natural' unitary representations of this group (like the
	regular representation) on irreducible ones. The infinite-dimensional
	unitary group U(infinity) is one of the basic examples of `big' groups
	whose irreducible representations depend on infinitely many parameters.
	Our aim is to explain what the harmonic analysis on U(infinity) consists
	of. We deal with unitary representations of a reasonable class, which
	are in 1-1 correspondence with characters (central, positive definite,
	normalized functions on U(infinity)). The decomposition of any representation
	of this class is described by a probability measure (called spectral
	measure) on the space of indecomposable characters. The indecomposable
	characters were found by Dan Voiculescu in 1976. The main result
	of the present paper consists in explicitly constructing a 4-parameter
	family of `natural' representations and computing their characters.
	We view these representations as a substitute of the nonexisting
	regular representation of U(infinity). We state the problem of harmonic
	analysis on U(infinity) as the problem of computing the spectral
	measures for these `natural' representations. A solution to this
	problem is given in the next paper math/0109194, joint with Alexei
	Borodin. We also prove a few auxiliary general results. In particular,
	it is proved that the spectral measure of any character of U(infinity)
	can be approximated by a sequence of (discrete) spectral measures
	for the restrictions of the character to the compact unitary groups
	U(N). This fact is a starting point for computing spectral measures.},

	abstract = {The matrix Whittaker kernel has been introduced by A. Borodin in Part
	IV of the present series of papers. This kernel describes a point
	process -- a probability measure on a space of countable point configurations.
	The kernel is expressed in terms of the Whittaker confluent hypergeometric
	functions. It depends on two parameters and determines a $J$-symmetric
	operator $K$ in $L^2(R_+)\oplus L^2(R_+)$. It turns out that the
	operator $K$ can be represented in the form $L(1+L)^{-1}$, where
	$L$ is a rather simple integral operator: the kernel of $L$ is expressed
	in terms of elementary functions only. This is our main result; it
	elucidates the nature of the matrix Whittaker kernel and makes it
	possible to directly verify the existence of the associated point
	process. Next, we show that the matrix Whittaker kernel can be degenerated
	to a family of kernels expressed through the Bessel and Macdonald
	functions. In this way one can obtain both the well-known Bessel
	kernel (which arises in random matrix theory) and certain interesting
	new kernels.},

	abstract = {The aim of the paper is to introduce a two-parameter family of infinite-dimensional
	diffusion processes X(alpha,theta) related to Pitman's two-parameter
	Poisson-Dirichlet distributions PD(alpha,theta). The diffusions X(alpha,theta)
	are obtained in a scaling limit transition from certain finite Markov
	chains on partitions of natural numbers. The state space of X(alpha,theta)
	is an infinite-dimensional simplex called the Kingman simplex. In
	the special case when parameter alpha vanishes, our finite Markov
	chains are similar to Moran-type model in population genetics, and
	our diffusion processes reduce to the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles
	diffusion model studied by Ethier and Kurtz (1981). Our main results
	extend those of Ethier and Kurtz to the two-parameter case and are
	as follows: The Poisson-Dirichlet distribution PD(alpha,theta) is
	a unique stationary distribution for the corresponding process X(alpha,theta);
	the process is ergodic and reversible; the spectrum of its generator
	is explicitly described. The general two-parameter case seems to
	fall outside the setting of models of population genetics, and our
	approach differs in some aspects from that of Ethier and Kurtz. We
	also consider the case of degenerate series of parameters alpha and

	two-parameter family of diffusions.},

	[ p + q - 1, p + q - 3,..., p - q + 1 ] with part size bounded by
	m is shown to be equal to the number of ordinary plane partitions
	contained in the shape (p, p,..., p) (q rows) with part size bounded

	representations of semisimple Lie algebras. A separate simpler argument
	shows that the number of chains of cardinality k in the poset underlying
	the shifted plane partitions is equal to the number of chains of
	cardinality k in the poset underlying the ordinary plane partitions.
	The first result can also be formulated as an equality of chain counts
	for a pair of posets. The pair of posets is obtained by taking order
	ideals in the other pair of posets.},

	In the second section we proceed with the examples of the determinantal
	random point fields from Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics,
	Random Matrix Theory, Probability Theory, Representation Theory and
	Ergodic Theory. In connection with the Theory of Renewal Processes
	we characterize all determinantal random point fields in R^1 and
	Z^1 with independent identically distributed spacings. In the third
	section we study the translation invariant determinantal random point
	fields and prove the mixing property of any multiplicity and the
	absolute continuity of the spectra. In the fourth (and the last)
	section we discuss the proofs of the Central Limit Theorem for the
	number of particles in the growing box and the Functional Central
	Limit Theorem for the empirical distribution function of spacings.},

	$Q_\lambda(x) P_\lambda(y)/Z$ where $Q_\lambda$ and $P_\lambda$ are
	the Schur $Q$-functions and $Z$ is a normalization constant. This
	measure, which we call the shifted Schur measure, is analogous to
	the much-studied Schur measure. For the specialization of the first
	$m$ coordinates of $x$ and the first $n$ coordinates of $y$ equal
	to $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha<1$) and the rest equal to zero, we derive
	a limit law for $\lambda_1$ as $m,n\ra\infty$ with $\tau=m/n$ fixed.
	For the Schur measure the $\alpha$-specialization limit law was derived
	by Johansson. Our main result implies that the two limit laws are

@article{Zirnbauer2010,
	abstract = {Physical systems exhibiting stochastic or chaotic behavior are often
	amenable to treatment by random matrix models. In deciding on a good
	choice of model, random matrix physics is constrained and guided
	by symmetry considerations. The notion of 'symmetry class' (not to
	be confused with 'universality class') expresses the relevance of
	symmetries as an organizational principle. Dyson, in his 1962 paper
	referred to as the Threefold Way, gave the prime classification of
	random matrix ensembles based on a quantum mechanical setting with
	symmetries. In this article we review Dyson's Threefold Way from
	a modern perspective. We then describe a minimal extension of Dyson's
	setting to incorporate the physics of chiral Dirac fermions and disordered
	superconductors. In this minimally extended setting, where Hilbert
	space is replaced by Fock space equipped with the anti-unitary operation
	of particle-hole conjugation, symmetry classes are in one-to-one
	correspondence with the large families of Riemannian symmetric spaces.},
