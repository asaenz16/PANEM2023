One may add resources directly to this file with any relevant links. Or, one may add files to this folder.

## Funding opportunities for collaborations

- MSRI/SLMath's Summer Research in Mathematics (SRiM)
  > Description:  The SRiM program provides space, funding, and the opportunity for in-person collaboration to
  > small groups of mathematicians, especially women and gender-expansive individuals, whose ongoing research
  > may have been disproportionately affected by various obstacles including family obligations, professional
  > isolation, or access to funding. Through this effort, MSRI aims to mitigate the obstacles faced by these groups,
  >  improve the odds of research project completion, and deepen their research experience.\

- American Institute of Mathematics SQuaREs
  > The purpose of AIMâ€™s research program called SQuaREs (Structured Quartet Research Ensembles) is to allow a
  >  dedicated group of four to six mathematicians to spend a week at AIM in San Jose, California, with the
  >  possibility of returning in following years. \
